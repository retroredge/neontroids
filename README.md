Neontroids
====

A Javascript version of Atari's 1979 classic Asteroids arcade game.

Whilst playing around with Javascript and HTML5 canvas I managed to get a nice neon affect line render working that I'd seen
done previously using CSS. I thought it would make a nice looking Asteroids clone so here it is.
